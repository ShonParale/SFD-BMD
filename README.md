This application is a user-friendly desktop tool designed for civil and structural engineers, students, and educators to analyze beams under various loading and support conditions. With an interactive graphical interface, users can define beam length, add supports (pin, roller, fixed, spring), and apply different types of loads including point loads, uniformly distributed loads (UDL), and varying distributed loads (VDL). The app calculates reactions, then automatically generates Shear Force Diagrams (SFD) and Bending Moment Diagrams (BMD), visualizing the internal forces along the beam.

Key features include:

Support for multiple beam configurations such as simply supported, cantilever, fixed-fixed, overhanging, and propped cantilever beams.

Step-by-step calculation breakdowns for transparency and learning.

Export options for diagrams (PNG, SVG, PDF), calculation steps (PDF), and numerical data (Excel).

Customizable units (SI and Imperial) for length, force, moment, and angle.

Light and dark mode themes for comfortable viewing.

A built-in user guide and keyboard shortcuts for efficient workflow.

No installation of Python or additional libraries is required; users can simply download and run the provided executable to start analyzing beams immediately
